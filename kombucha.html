        <h3>Kombucha Journal</h3>  
        <h4>6.25.23</h4>
        Chopped up about 1 kiwi each. Need to find a better way to get fruit inside the bottles - it's so messy. I may pull out the blender next time.<br><br>

        Post pour! I'm curious how green everything will look in the next couple days.<br>
        The first fermentation cycle was about 15 days. Gunning for ten with this one.<br><br>

        Updated look at the gallon jar after the sweet tea pour. The SCOBY is making its way up top.<br>
        You can see that there's WAY more liquid in this batch than the prior one. I wonder if I'm pouring enough of the base kombucha out.<br><br>

        <h4>6.24.23</h4>
        Getting ready to pour tomorrow's batch. Checkout a progress pic of the SCOBY. Not only did it float back to the top - there was surface growth independent of the old SCOBY.<br>
        You can see the two separate entities if you look closely. I'm very curious how the taste of this batch will be affected by the layer pruning.<br><br>
        <img src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 354.71px; height: 473.50px;"></span><br><br>
        Attaching a pour video as well. I have to brew the sweet tea overnight to let it get to room temp. The SCOBY will die if it's exposed to boiling water. <br>
        Side note: I hate that youtube makes vertical videos “shorts” by default.<br><br>

        <h4>6.11.23</h4>
        I uncorked the kombucha yesterday. The half bottle had way too many blueberries so it was basically just fruit juice.<br>
        When I uncorked the bottles there was definitely pressure but none of the bottles came close to exploding.<br><br>
        <img src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 354.71px; height: 473.50px;"></span><br><br>
        
        I brought the kombucha over to a party last night to use as a chaser and Evan gave feedback.<br>
        Taste Review:
        <ul class="myUL2"></ul>
            <li>Carbonation level is good. The blueberry flavor isn't overpowering</li>
            <li>The sour tang seems to be a little overwhelming (still)</li>
        <br>

        I decided to clean out the gallon jar to address the aggressive “tang”. <br>
        I threw away a bunch of the SCOBY layers and stored the top layer inside a tupperware overnight (with two cups of kombucha from the original jar). <br>
        This was the first clean that the jar had in about two months. I'm eager to see how this affects the flavor (if at all) <br><br>
        <img src="images/image6.jpg" style="width: 354.71px; height: 473.50px;"></span><br><br>
        Worth noting that the structural integrity of the SCOBY seems to have been affected by its overnight move. It's currently sinking :( <br><br>

        <h4>Approximately 6.1.23</h4>

        Batch 4 or 5:
        <ul class="myUL2"></ul>
            <li>Start Date: May 31 in the Morning</li>
            <li>4.5 bottles of blueberry (between ⅓ and ½ cup each)</li>
            <li>Let carbonate for 10 days (no burping)</li>
