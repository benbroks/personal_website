In Fall 2024, I cycled 3900+ miles from San Francisco, California to Yorktown, VA in 51 days. I did the majority of the route (Sacramento, CA to Virginia) solo. I didn’t even own a bike until 2 weeks before the trip. How'd that happen?
#### The Route

All of my research led me to the Adventure Cycling Association (ACA) [maps](https://www.adventurecycling.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/RouteNetwork_MP_3_20_24.pdf). The ACA sells gpx files that cover turn-by-turn directions and include a corresponding Services file for each route that tells you where all the campgrounds, convenience stores, motels, and tourism POIs are along the route.

The most popular cross-country route is the TransAmerica, created in 1976 for the USA bicentennial. It starts in Astoria, OR and runs 4200 miles before finishing in Yorktown, VA. I was initially interested in following this route. However, due to my last minute planning (late August), I couldn’t start the ride until September 21. By that time, sections of the Trans America in Montana and Wyoming would be snowed out. It’s generally recommended that you _complete_ the Trans America before the day I decided to start biking.

With the Trans America nixed, I looked further south. The Southern Tier route (San Diego, CA to Saint Augustine, FL) looked compelling but I checked out a few Reddit reviews and everyone said it was boring, particularly the 1000 mile stretch through Texas. Most folks had positive things to say about the Western Express (San Francisco, CA to Pueblo, CO), minus complaints about how challenging the ride was, but reviews were mixed when it came to riding through it in the early Fall. I decided to roll the dice, hope there was no snow in the Rockies when I passed through Southern Colorado via the Western Express, and meet up with the Trans America in Pueblo. I was confident I could pass through the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic without encountering bad weather, assuming I made it over the Continental Divide safely.

#### The Prep  

There a few important areas of preparation here:
- Physical Prep -> how do I bike every day without ripping my body apart?
- Survival Prep -> how do I sleep comfortably every night without freezing/overheating and make sure I never run out of food & water?
- Biking Prep -> how do I repair my bicycle when I don't have service and my tire goes flat?

I bought a touring bike on Craigslist (insert photo) while assembling all my gear for the trip. I logged a couple practice rides with the bike in Central Park but never went above 30 miles at a time. I was feeling quite nervous that I wouldn’t be physically capable of long rides for the first couple weeks but was confident I could build up if need be. I have a distance running background and was midway through a training plan for the NYC Marathon (which I ended up skipping to finish the bike tour). I was confident that my running aerobic base would transition well to cycling, even if my quads weren’t primed for the pedaling load. In practice, this ended up being alright. I was definitely sore for the first two weeks of the ride but I never got injured. The key is to push through muscle soreness but never tendon soreness. If your knees hurt while you're pedaling, you need to move to a lower gear. You also may consider getting a bike fitting! These are expensive (i got mine for $400 at [enduranceWERX in Harlem](https://www.endurancewerx.com/)) but will make the bicycle feel like an extension of your body and are the best way to prevent injuries.

Preparing for camping all the time might require a bit more practice. I did a lot of backpacking trips in college (shout-out [Peaks & Professors](https://www.peaksandprofessors.org/)) so I was all set here. You'll definitely want to practice using a water filter in a stream/lake, setting up a tent by yourself in the dark, preparing a meal with a camping stove, and breaking down a campsite into a small pack. Of course, doing a short overnight trip in advance would be the best practice.

I was a complete noob on the cycling maintenance side before preparing for this trip. I had never changed a tire and didn't even own a bike (just had a NYC Citibike subscription). The best practice for this would be taking your bike apart and putting it back together. When I flew to San Francisco to start the ride, I had a cycling shop disassemble my bike and pack it into a cardboard box so I could check it as an oversized bag. Rebuilding the bike to kick off the trip was a great way to get familiar with my tools and the bicycle itself. Additionally, you should be prepared to grease your chain, replace a flat tire on both wheels, and use a [Quick Link](https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/chain-quick-links) on a broken chain.

What's more important than any physical preparation is **the willpower to get the trip done**. There will be hard moments on the trail - I found myself crying on the side of the road more than once. No amount of training can tell you that you just need to get up every morning and make progress. Accordingly, really anyone can complete this trip. People have been doing it since the 1890s and elderly folks complete the course every year. You just have to keep chugging along!
#### The Gear

Being on the road for several weeks straight requires a few key supplies.

Bike: I bought an old school Trek 520 off Craigslist for < $500. Although it's heavy, this frame is considered to be a _classic_ bike touring frame. I got compliments on it throughout my whole ride. I will say that I didn't find any other good bikes on Craigslist/Facebook Marketplace in the Manhattan/Brooklyn area that were under $1k. You should expect to spend > $1500 if you want a brand new touring bike. Go used if you can.

Bike Accessories: I used a [Rockbros Rear Rack](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07219CDH7) and [Two Rockbros Panniers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCDPBMN1?th=1) to store the majority of my supplies. Rockbros makes high quality waterproof bags. I cycled/camp through several rainstorms and water never made it inside them. Similarly, the straps on the side of the panniers are a great spot for air-drying your overnight washed clothes! I chose not to buy a front rack and loaded all the weight on my back tire, which **I would not recommend**. You can fit everything you need in two panniers, but I'd suggest putting one on a front rack and one on a rear rack. You'll also want to make sure the frame has a bottle cage - my bike came with one pre-installed.

Bike Maintenance & Repair: I used a [leatherman multitool](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005KSWIIY?th=1) and [crankbrothers multitool](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000S6HZCC?th=1) for all my tightening, pinching, and cutting needs. I used a [small portable pump](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NZ8V8XP), [a pair of levers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FDX2ZJ2?th=1), a patch kit (talk to any bike shop), and two spare tubes for tire-related maintenance. I replaced my tires (and got another spare tube) about halfway through the trip. I brought a roll of duct tape, which comes in handy if you rip a hole in your tire. I also carried a [Quick Link](https://www.amazon.com/Bibike-Missing-Reusable-Bicycle-12spd/dp/B08PSVD28B?crid=2IBLVT4F0Y8CC&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ucuhcfjCu70Z0WkNpXTBSQ12XxK9TtQ9lrXVb0mCHmG_eFOcK_-yPm7w4JywVywnmQS0EBtsaqgTVpxDrwvq8AhPzWZwd5RVeOOqaVrh8ZrZsnRBtlc1FJj2brFiDAvnQIKuosoCUJHtPTjAwN43OyLEMNlNjz1fAlbNSel3c-jKzg-n074j26UgXDPiavDLmG4pnJa4e_a6HlU2D3c6llmqn6KAg35dthWJ60wDnOEOMffQtp-tfa2-hQaWnt3vPXOJbXs98xS86Bb0K8YInd_TKINF2-nmFd8HdXW_Fb8.2k6uPSj4TZDMrQCYQXNG0nSy-pMyTGgepCv5_Hg0Lvw&dib_tag=se&keywords=quick+link+bike&qid=1733706625&s=sporting-goods&sprefix=quick+link+bik,sporting,125&sr=1-6) but never ended up needing it.

Safety: I used a [MIPS helmet](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JCLJZDJ), [reflective vest](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091N8MF55), re-chargeable [front light](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071ZJYF78?th=1), and re-chargeable [rear light](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BR5MKRP9) at all times. I didn't do any night riding unless an emergency demanded it. The primary risk of cycling is drivers hitting cyclists, usually because drivers can't see them. It's on you as a cyclist to be undeniably visible - you should be obnoxiously bright and reflective. Not only is it safer, your crazy outfit is a fantastic conversation starter. I brought pepper spray to deal with dogs but never ended up using it - I've heard it's easier to use an air horn instead. I brought a 20 ft rope to string up my pack in bear country. I always packed spray sunscreen for my arms, legs, and neck and lotion for my face. I also carried Tylenol, eye drops, chapstick, bandaids, and a small pack of Mylar thermal blankets!

Shelter: I spent the majority of nights on my trip inside a [Naturehike Cloud-Up 1 Person Tent](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FJVVDSX). I was happy with the volume of the assembled tent as a 5'11" person. It was also a small, light piece of luggage. That said, the tent didn't make it through an overnight rainstorm without leaking water through the floor. I'd recommend finding another one :/ I also brought a [20 degree rated sleeping bag](https://www.marmot.com/equipment/sleeping-bags/synthetic/trestles-elite-eco-20-sleeping-bag/AFS_889169471551.html)and a [small sleeping pad](https://www.thermarest.com/sleeping-pads/fast-and-light/z-lite-sol-sleeping-pad/z-lite-sol.html). You won't need that much sleeping bag insulation if you do the trip in the summer like a normal person.

Water Storage: For water access in underpopulated areas, I used a [Sawyer Squeeze water filter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B1OSU4W). It's important to note that these filters are rendered ineffective if exposed to sub-freezing temperatures. I packed a 6 liter water container (I'd occasionally duct-tape to this to the frame), a 2 liter camelbak, and a [small Rockbros water bottle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSSVTL4L) for water access while I was in motion. In retrospect, the camelbak tube was a pain to pack and it would often leak. You can get away with a couple big storage bags that are designed to be emptied out into a classic water bottle/cooking stove.

Clothing: The rule of thumb here is that you need 2+ sets of active wear and one set of camp clothes. For daily riding, I brought 2 [Ultimate Black Bibs](https://theblackbibs.com/products/the-black-bibs-ultimate)  and 2 [neon riding shirts](hhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J2WHCYS). It's worth noting that the zippers on my riding shirts broke almost immediately. I brought a set of tights for riding in cold mornings. I brought three pairs of socks - I went for warm workout socks because of the season. I wore clip-in shoes for riding and Birkenstocks for camp. Noting I traveled from late September to early November, the temperature peaked at 85 in the Nevada Desert and dropped down to 28/29 overnight in Gunnison, CO.

Electronics: I brought an iPhone 11, a [Garmin Edge 530](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QBDG3TR) (bike computer), a Garmin inReach (satellite phone), a [portable charger](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B28ZSWLS), and necessary cords! The 530 was great at recording my daily rides but it isn't meant to be used for trip planning or waypoint finding. On iOS, I'd recommend downloading GPX files via GoodReader, then transferring those files over to EasyTrails for easy viewing/navigation. I used EasyTrails every morning to plan out my ride for the day. Notably, I did not bring headphones. It's more fun without them!

Camping Accoutrements: For cooking, I brought a [900 mL kettle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CL8353KL) and a [SOTO windmaster stove](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R7BZCB3). I packed in a small canister of cooking fuel that I replaced every 2-3 weeks. I packed a Black Diamond headlamp for moving around camp at night. I used a 4oz container of [Dr. Bronner's](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009EIMRA) for cleaning dishes, as well as nightly showers/laundry. I hear it can also be used as toothpaste but I never tried. That needed replacement every 2 weeks or so. I packed a small wash cloth that doubled as a towel. I also loaded up on [Chamois Butt'r ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000HZGTUS). Try as you may to escape chafing and sores, they're unfortunately an inevitability. That said, the chammy butter makes things a little easier. 
#### Sustenance

Planning my food and water consumption was the most logistically challenging component of the trip. Because I was weight constrained and typically only packed 12-24 hours worth of food/water, I needed to constantly monitor where the closest grocery stores and water sources were. The most common grocery chains on the trail were Family Dollar & Dollar General. These chains are price-friendly. They have a variety of instant meals and calorically dense snacks. I wouldn't recommend shopping there if you're looking for a nutritionally balanced shopping cart, but they're perfect for a cyclist exclusively in need of carbs. My favorite instant meals included mashed potatoes, beans & rice, ramen, and pasta. I avoided canned food as it added unnecessary water weight to my pack.

I'm vegetarian, and rural America doesn't lend itself well to that dietary restriction. That said, while there wasn't much variety, I could usually find _something_ to eat. I reliably found Mexican restaurants along the route, and if there was a bar that only served burgers I'd usually be able to convince them to make me a grilled cheese.

Given I averaged 7 hours on the bike, I generally ate between 4,000 and 6,000 calories a day. 
For breakfast, I would always have instant oatmeal and instant coffee. The key is to make the oatmeal inside the packets so there are fewer dishes to clean - the boiling water also warms up your hands on cold mornings. 40-50% of that intake was trail mix. I would grab snacks at the grocery store to eat every 80 minutes during sunscreen breaks - usually it was peanut butter pretzels, [Clover Valley's Monster Trail Mix](https://www.dollargeneral.com/p/clover-valley-monster-trail-mix-oz/753519476285), or Ritz Cheese Sandwiches. By the end of the ride, I was probably eating both lunch and dinner at some restaurant, which is definitely the more expensive way to do the ride. Subway was a great option - I could eat half of a footlong sub for lunch and save the rest for dinner at my campsite.

I regularly bought electrolyte packets at the grocery store. In the desert, you should be prepared to go through a full bottle (20 oz) of water every hour. And as much as _every other_ bottle should be an electrolyte drink. As I moved further east, there'd be days when I'd only need a bottle of water every four hours, no electrolytes necessary. Regardless, you should overpack on water. Running out of it in the wrong place will kill you. I needed **all 8.5 liters of my storage** on the longest stretch without services (between Hanksville and Blanding in SE Utah).

#### Sleeping Spots

The best source of truth for places to sleep is the ACA map. The waypoints will list a location, a phone number to call, and occasionally a website to visit for bookings. These range from a free place to sleep with no running water to a car campsite to a hotel with breakfast included. Most nights on my trip involved some form of camping, with varying access to bathroom/shower facilities. I did occasionally stay in Airbnbs or motels but I tried to use those as a last resort following particularly challenging riding days.

I'd recommend making a [Warm Showers](https://www.warmshowers.org/) account in advance of any bike tour. There are a number of generous Warm Showers hosts across the country that will let cyclists stay in their homes for free, occasionally even providing a free meal, access to laundry machines or showers. I stayed in a few such homes in Colorado and Kentucky - I remember those nights fondly.

I generally didn't plan sleeping arrangements more than 36 hours in advance. My mileage was highly dependent on weather, elevation change, and unforeseen delays so I had a hard time making multi-day plans.  For example, when attempting to cross the Ohio River between Illinois and Kentucky, I didn't realize that I needed to take a ferry over the water. And the ferry was conveniently closed over the weekend when I arrived at the north bank at 3pm on a Sunday.

You'll find lots of RV parks west of the Rockies that are open for overnight bike tourists. They'll usually include a small campsite, access to running water, electricity, showers, and coin laundry machines. These are safe places to stay and great places to meet other traveling sightseers. They pretty much disappear once you cross over into Eastern Colorado though. There were always spots to camp along the route as I went eastward, but they were often small plots in public parks with sparing access to water, showers, or bathrooms. I'd often have to call the local sheriff's office to let them know I would be spending the night at the park. In a pinch, you can always stop by the local fire department and ask them where the best campsite is. Sometimes they'll even let you sleep inside the station.

Some notable places I spent the night:
- a church basement in Kansas
- a fire station in Kentucky
- a greenhouse in Virginia
- an old pony express station in Nevada
- an RV park that doubled as a goat/pony farm in Colorado
- a bed&breakfast for Appalachian Trail hikers in Damascus, VA
- a shack outside a bar in Illinois
#### On Safety

I never felt unsafe around other people as I was passing through strange towns on my route. I'd always leave my bike unlocked and, assuming the forecast didn't call for rain, my supply bags outside of my tent overnight. I'd often start conversations with strangers over lunch/dinner and chat with dog walkers as I set up camp in public parks. Admittedly, I completed the trip as a 25 year old white guy, so use that anecdotal evidence at your own risk.

The only precaution I tried to take was making sure my electronics were on me at all times. I'd always put my bike computer and phone in my pocket when heading into restaurants and grocery stores. I spoke with another cross-country cycling group when making my way through Nevada and one man mentioned that his phone was stolen off his bike when he left it unattended while grabbing a drink at a gas station. 

It is worth mentioning that much of the rural American West doesn't have cell service. **A satellite phone is an absolute necessity**. You should be able to quickly make SOS calls in dire circumstances and notify loved ones as to your exact location regardless of access to cell towers. I made sure to broadcast my coordinates twice a day and keep my family/girlfriend updated as to my travel plans every morning for my own safety. I was unexpectedly delayed by a flat tire on a mountain with no bars on two separate occasions.

You should have a general idea of the wildlife (and according precautions to take) in every region you pass through. For example, passing through bear country requires you to either string up all your scented supplies or put them in a bear canister. That was particularly important as I made my way through El Dorado National Forest between Sacramento & South Lake Tahoe. Similarly, I didn't realize that Black Widow spiders were native to Nevada (and live in burrows right under the sand surface) until I found one crawling toward my tent. I triple-checked my cycling shoes for overnight visitors after that :)

#### Simple Joys of the Ride

Cycling across the continent is one of the best ways to see the environmental diversity and scale of the United States. Imagine pretty much any biome - you'll bike through it if you go from the Pacific to the Atlantic. I went through several national parks and more than a dozen state parks as I threaded my way to Virginia. Similarly, the views of the night sky are spectacular as you depart from the city centers. 

You'll also find that a bike touring outfit and gear collection makes you stick out like a sore thumb. Accordingly, you should expect strangers to be inquisitive. People will usually have stories of their own - either they know someone who has done something similar or are into cycling themselves. These conversations with strangers were some of high points of my trip. I met people from all walks of life, and oftentimes they would offer to help in any way they could. Complete strangers would hand me extra food, buy me dinner, pull up beside me on the road to ask if I needed help, offer a room in their house for the night, or get their hands dirty to help me replace a flat tire. Again, this was an n=1 experience, but I was pleasantly surprised by the  generosity and kindness I encountered pretty much everywhere. What's more, I would occasionally meet crazy cyclists like me. I bumped into an Australian couple heading from Vancouver to Argentina on mountain bikes, a crew of people cycling from Boston to San Francisco with van support, and two Frenchman heading from Montreal to San Francisco.

Another cool part of traveling the TransAmerica trail is showing up to restaurants/rest stops in small towns that regularly see cyclists. Most of these places have log books dating back years that contain notes from every cyclist who's passed through. Particularly if you're riding alone, it's inspiring to feel like you're part of a hallowed tradition.

#### An unordered list of things worth considering:
- The climb from Somerset, CA to the peak above South Lake Tahoe is sustained and there are long stretches without water.
- There are basically six places to comfortably camp in Nevada so you better plan on biking some multiple of 70 miles per day or sleeping on the side of the road.
- The 20 mile climb (4% grade) out of Cedar City, UT is unbelievably brutal. 
- The 10 mile climb (5% grade) to summit the Continental divide is similarly brutal.
- The 125 mile stretch between Hanksville and Blanding, Utah is nightmarish. There are NO SERVICES and only one water source (filter required).
- Don't believe anybody who tells you there are "prevailing winds". Eastern Colorado and Kansas are so flat and so windy (both directions) that it will reduce you to tears.
- The Ozarks are hillier than you'd expect. Several of my top 5 net elevation gain days were in Missouri. 
- Appalachia is the steepest range on the route. There are several 2+ mile 7-8% grade climbs in Kentucky & Virginia.

#### Resources I Found Useful

My gear list and general trip prep was heavily informed by Sam Westby's How I Biked Across the U.S. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmynR8N8lNE) and corresponding [doc](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q_Oy58lwhOE_KCXRvcA8mGcItO8Vf_Ph/view). I'd highly recommend both - you can get 90% of the way there without consuming anything else.

These videos captured the vibe of the Western Express quite well:
