I spent 51 straight days on my bicycle last year, traveling 3,900 miles through high desert, mountain passes, endless prairies, and rolling hills from San Francisco, California to the eastern coast of Virginia. I did the majority of the route (Sacramento to Virginia) solo. Yet I didn’t even own a bike until two weeks before the trip. How'd that happen?

### ![][image1]

After [shutting down my startup](https://www.brooks.team/posts/on-directai/) in summer 2024, I was burned out and unsure what to do next. Accordingly, I sat down to brainstorm a few crazy ideas in hopes of tackling a meaningful challenge and taking time to clear my head. I considered, but ultimately ruled out due to skill/weather issues, ideas to sail across an ocean or hike the Appalachian or Pacific Crest trails. Bicycling across the continent seemed like the perfect blend of crazy and possible.

### The Route

All of my research led me to the Adventure Cycling Association (ACA) [maps](https://www.adventurecycling.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/RouteNetwork_MP_3_20_24.pdf). The ACA sells digital routes as gpx files \- each route contains turn-by-turn directions along with a detailed list of waypoints marking campgrounds, convenience stores, motels, and notable tourist attractions along the route.

The most popular cross-country route is the TransAmerica Trail, created in 1976 for the United States Bicentennial. It starts in Astoria, Oregon and runs 4200 miles before finishing in Yorktown, Virginia. Although I was initially interested in following this route, due to my last minute planning (late August), I couldn’t start the ride until September 21\. By that time of year, sections of the TransAmerica in Montana and Wyoming are typically snowed out. All the advice I read recommended *completing* the TransAmerica before the time of year I decided to *start.*  
![][image2]

With the northern sections of the TransAmerica nixed, I looked further south. The **Southern Tier Route** (San Diego, California to Saint Augustine, Florida) looked compelling but I checked out a few Reddit reviews and everyone said it was boring, particularly the 1000 mile stretch through Texas. Besides complaints about how challenging the ride was, most folks had positive things to say about the **Western Express** (San Francisco, California to Pueblo, Colorado). The trail is largely remote so there’s barely any suburban traffic and it weaves through several spectacular national parks and mountain ranges. That said, reviews were mixed about whether to attempt such a ride in October. I decided to roll the dice, hope there was no snow in the Rockies when I passed through Southern Colorado via the Western Express, and rejoin the TransAmerica route in Pueblo. I was confident I could pass through the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic without encountering bad weather, assuming I made it over the Continental Divide safely.

### The Prep

There were a few important areas of preparation here:  
\- Fitness Prep \-\> how do I bike every day without ripping my body apart?  
\- Survival Prep \-\> how do I sleep comfortably every night without freezing/overheating and make sure I never run out of food & water?  
\- Mechanical Prep \-\> how do I repair my bicycle when I don't have service and my tire goes flat?

I bought a touring bike on Craigslist while assembling all my gear for the trip. In all honesty, my physical preparation was minimal \- I only logged a couple short practice rides around Central Park, never exceeding 30 miles. Though I did worry about my ability to bike long distances, I was confident in my general fitness. At the time, I was halfway through training for the NYC Marathon (which I ultimately skipped to finish the bike tour), and I figured that aerobic fitness would carry over well, even if my quads weren't fully conditioned. My instincts were mostly right. I was definitely sore for the first two weeks of the ride but I never got injured. The key was to push through muscle soreness but never tendon soreness. If there was a pinching or pulling sensation in my knees while I pedaled, I needed to move to a lower gear. Once I started the trip, I just woke up every morning expecting some baseline quad soreness.

One move I don’t regret making is getting a **bike fitting** in advance of the ride. These are expensive (I got mine for $400 at [enduranceWERX in Harlem](https://www.endurancewerx.com)) but it made the bicycle feel like an extension of my body and, so I hear, is the best way to prevent injuries.

For the reader, preparing for camping every night might require a bit more practice. A typical backcountry night involved me collecting water from a nearby stream before running it through my filter, boiling water with my camp stove to make an instant meal, hand-washing my clothes before hanging them to dry, giving myself a “shower” with a travel washcloth, and setting up my tent (often in the dark). In the morning, I’d wake up 90+ minutes before sunrise to make a quick breakfast and break down camp into a small pack that re-attached to my bike before heading out for the day. I was fortunate to go on a bunch of backpacking trips during college (shout out [Peaks & Professors](https://www.peaksandprofessors.org/)) so I was comfortable with all of the above. For those less experienced, I’d recommend doing a couple practice overnight trips to get the hang of using your gear before setting off on the long haul journey.

I was a complete noob on the cycling maintenance side before preparing for this trip. I had never changed a tire and didn't even own a bike (just had a NYC Citibike subscription). Before I flew to San Francisco to start the ride, I had a cycling shop disassemble my bike and pack it into a cardboard box so I could check it as an oversized bag. Rebuilding the bike to kick off the trip was a great way to get familiar with my tools and the bicycle itself. If I were to relay advice to my past self, I’d also say to be prepared to grease your chain, replace a flat tire on both wheels, and use a [Quick Link](https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/chain-quick-links) on a broken chain. Luckily, I never had to fix a broken chain but my back tire did go flat 8 times during the trip and my chain would regularly detach from the gears. 

What's more important than any physical preparation is **the willpower to get the trip done**. There will be hard moments on the trail \- I found myself crying on the side of the road more than once. No amount of training could have prepared me for the daily struggle of simply getting up and making progress. But this experience is not reserved for experts and athletes. People have been making the trek since long before the federal interstate existed and elderly cyclists manage it every year. The key is to just keep chugging along\!

### The Gear

Being on the road for several weeks straight requires a few key supplies. Full Disclosure: All the Amazon products below have affiliate hyperlinks.

Bike: I bought an old school Trek 520 off Craigslist for less than $500. Although it's heavy, this frame is considered to be a *classic* bike touring frame. I got compliments on it throughout my ride. I will say that I didn't find any other good bikes on Craigslist/Facebook Marketplace in the Manhattan/Brooklyn area that were under $1000. A brand new touring bike will run you at least $1500. I’d recommend going used if possible.


Bike Accessories: I used a [Rockbros Rear Rack](https://amzn.to/4jlLHC1) and two [Rockbros Panniers](https://amzn.to/4ckiLIh) to store the majority of my supplies. Rockbros makes high quality waterproof bags. I cycled and camped through torrential rainstorms in Missouri, Kentucky, and Virginia \- water never made it inside the bags. The straps on the side of the panniers are also a great spot for air-drying wet clothes. I chose not to buy a front rack and loaded all the weight on my back tire, which **I would not recommend**. All the necessary gear can fit into two panniers, but I’d recommend putting one on a front rack and one on a rear rack. It’s also worth having a bottle cage on the frame to have easy access to water while in the saddle \- my bike came with one pre-installed.

Bike Maintenance & Repair: I used a [leatherman multitool](https://amzn.to/3FWDR3m) and [crankbrothers multitool](https://amzn.to/3E6icFm) for all my tightening, pinching, and cutting needs. For tire-related maintenance, I used a [small portable pump](https://amzn.to/3FVZf8W), a [pair of levers](https://amzn.to/4chCyrM), a patch kit (talk to any bike shop), and two spare tubes. I replaced my tires (and got another spare tube) about halfway through the trip. I brought along a roll of duct tape, which comes in handy when a thorn or piece of glass rips a sizable hole in the tire itself. I also carried a [Quick Link](https://www.amazon.com/Bibike-Missing-Reusable-Bicycle-12spd/dp/B08PSVD28B?crid=2IBLVT4F0Y8CC&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ucuhcfjCu70Z0WkNpXTBSQ12XxK9TtQ9lrXVb0mCHmG_eFOcK_-yPm7w4JywVywnmQS0EBtsaqgTVpxDrwvq8AhPzWZwd5RVeOOqaVrh8ZrZsnRBtlc1FJj2brFiDAvnQIKuosoCUJHtPTjAwN43OyLEMNlNjz1fAlbNSel3c-jKzg-n074j26UgXDPiavDLmG4pnJa4e_a6HlU2D3c6llmqn6KAg35dthWJ60wDnOEOMffQtp-tfa2-hQaWnt3vPXOJbXs98xS86Bb0K8YInd_TKINF2-nmFd8HdXW_Fb8.2k6uPSj4TZDMrQCYQXNG0nSy-pMyTGgepCv5_Hg0Lvw&dib_tag=se&keywords=quick+link+bike&qid=1733706625&s=sporting-goods&sprefix=quick+link+bik,sporting,125&sr=1-6) but never ended up needing it.

Safety: I used a [MIPS helmet](https://amzn.to/4jkIxOX), [reflective vest](https://amzn.to/44d8A6d), re-chargeable [front light](https://amzn.to/4lfgget), and re-chargeable [rear light](https://amzn.to/4lhHeSr) at all times. I didn't do any night riding unless an emergency demanded it. The primary risk of cycling is drivers hitting cyclists, usually because drivers can't see them. For better or worse, it's on cyclists to be undeniably visible \- being appropriately cautious means being obnoxiously bright and reflective. Not only is it safer, wearing a crazy outfit is a fantastic conversation starter. I brought pepper spray to deal with loose dogs but never ended up using it \- I've heard it's easier to use an air horn instead. I brought a 20 ft rope to string up my pack in bear country, sunscreen lotion for my face, and spray sunscreen for my legs/arms/neck. My first aid kit included Tylenol, eye drops, chapstick, bandaids, and even a small pack of Mylar thermal blankets.

Shelter: I spent the majority of nights on my trip inside a [Naturehike Cloud-Up 1 Person Tent](https://amzn.to/3DWPAOT). I was happy with the volume of the assembled tent as a 5'11" person. It was also a small, light (\~1500 grams) piece of luggage. That said, the tent didn't make it through an overnight rainstorm without leaking water through the floor. I'd recommend finding another one :/ I also brought a [20-degree sleeping bag](https://www.marmot.com/equipment/sleeping-bags/synthetic/trestles-elite-eco-20-sleeping-bag/AFS_889169471551.html) and a [small sleeping pad](https://www.thermarest.com/sleeping-pads/fast-and-light/z-lite-sol-sleeping-pad/z-lite-sol.html). If I had taken the trip in the summer, a 40-degree bag would probably have sufficed.

Water Storage: For water access in underpopulated areas, I used a [Sawyer Squeeze water filter](https://amzn.to/4j413eO). It's important to note that these filters are rendered ineffective if exposed to sub-freezing temperatures. If it got chilly enough overnight, I’d throw the filter in my sleeping bag so it wouldn’t freeze. I packed a 6-liter water container (I'd occasionally duct-tape this to the frame), a 2-liter camelbak, and a small [Rockbros water bottle](https://amzn.to/4lkpNAR) for water access while I was in motion. In retrospect, the camelbak tube was a pain to pack and it would often leak. In retrospect, I should have just used a couple big storage bags that are designed to be emptied out into a classic water bottle/cooking stove.

Clothing: The rule of thumb I followed was 2+ sets of active wear and one set of camp clothes. For daily riding, I brought 2 [Ultimate Black Bibs](https://theblackbibs.com/products/the-black-bibs-ultimate) and 2 [neon riding shirts](https://amzn.to/3R5YkoQ). It's worth noting that the zippers on my riding shirts broke almost immediately. I brought a set of tights for riding on cold mornings. I brought three pairs of socks \- I went for warm workout socks because of the season. I wore clip-in shoes for riding and Birkenstocks for camp. Noting I traveled from late September to early November: the temperature peaked at 85 in the Nevada Desert and dropped down to 28/29 overnight in Gunnison, Colorado. It stayed in the 40-60 range as I passed through the midwest and Appalachia.

\[TODO: insert MOV of my frozen socks\]

Electronics: I brought an iPhone 11, a [Garmin Edge 530](https://amzn.to/4lkGTyC) (bike computer), a Garmin inReach (satellite phone), a [portable charger](https://amzn.to/42ktw8K), and necessary cords. The 530 was great at recording my daily rides and buzzing when I needed to make a turn to stay on the route but it isn't meant to be used for trip planning or waypoint finding. On iOS, I'd recommend downloading GPX files via GoodReader, then transferring those files over to EasyTrails for easy viewing/navigation. I used EasyTrails every morning to plan out my ride for the day. Notably, I did not bring headphones. It's more fun without them\!

Camping Accoutrements: For cooking, I brought a [900 mL kettle](https://amzn.to/42zCQHe), [SOTO windmaster stove](https://amzn.to/3FRBmz9), and a small canister of cooking fuel (to be replaced every 2-3 weeks). A [Black Diamond headlamp](https://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en_US/product/astro-300/) helped me navigate around camp at night. For cleaning dishes, laundry, and showers, I brought a 4oz container of [Dr. Bronner's](https://amzn.to/4clF5kD) (to be replaced every 2 weeks). I hear it can also be used as toothpaste but I never tested it out myself. Additionally, I carried a small washcloth that doubled as a towel. While nigh impossible to completely escape chafing and saddle sores on such a long ride, [Chamois Butt’r](https://amzn.to/3FVvULD) made the discomfort more manageable.

### Sustenance

Planning my food and water consumption was the most logistically challenging component of the trip. Because I was weight constrained and typically only packed a day's worth of food/water, I needed to constantly monitor where the closest grocery stores and water sources were. The most common grocery chains on the trail were Family Dollar & Dollar General. These chains are price-friendly. They have a variety of instant meals and calorie-dense snacks. I wouldn't recommend shopping there if you're looking for a nutritionally balanced diet, but they're perfect for a cyclist exclusively in need of carbs. My favorite instant meals included mashed potatoes, beans & rice, ramen, and pasta. I avoided canned food as it added unnecessary water weight to my pack.

I'm vegetarian, and rural America doesn't lend itself well to that dietary restriction. That said, while there wasn't much variety, I could usually find *something* to eat. I reliably found mexican restaurants along the route, and if there was a bar that only served burgers I'd usually be able to convince them to make me a grilled cheese.

Given my daily average was about 7 hours on the bike, I generally ate between 4,000 and 6,000 calories a day. 

For breakfast, I would always have instant oatmeal and instant coffee. The key was to make the oatmeal inside the packets so there are fewer dishes to clean \- the boiling water also warmed up my hands on cold mornings. 40-50% of that intake was trail mix. I would grab snacks at the grocery store to eat every 80 minutes during sunscreen breaks \- usually it was peanut butter pretzels, [Clover Valley's Monster Trail Mix](https://www.dollargeneral.com/p/clover-valley-monster-trail-mix-oz/753519476285), or Ritz Cheese Sandwiches. By the end of the ride, I was probably eating both lunch and dinner at some restaurant, which is definitely the more expensive way to do the ride. Subway was a great option \- I could eat half of a footlong sub for lunch and save the rest for dinner at my campsite.

I regularly bought electrolyte packets at the grocery store. In the desert, I was prepared to go through a full bottle (20 oz) of water every hour. And as much as every other bottle needed to be an electrolyte drink. As I moved further east, there'd be days when I'd only need a bottle of water every four hours, no electrolytes necessary. Regardless, I always tried to overpack on water. Running out of it in the wrong place is a death sentence. I needed **all 8.5 liters of my storage** on the longest stretch without services (between Hanksville and Blanding in SE Utah).

### Sleeping Spots

The best source of truth for places to sleep is the ACA map. The waypoints will list a location, a phone number to call, and occasionally a website to visit for bookings. These range from a free place to sleep with no running water to a car campsite to a hotel with breakfast included. Most nights on my trip involved some form of camping, with varying access to bathroom/shower facilities. I did occasionally stay in Airbnbs or motels but I tried to use those as a last resort following particularly challenging riding days.

I'd recommend making a [Warmshowers](https://www.warmshowers.org) account in advance of any bike tour. There are a number of generous Warmshowers hosts across the country that will let cyclists stay in their homes for free, occasionally even providing a free meal, access to laundry machines or showers. In Pueblo, Colorado, one such host drove across town to pick me up after my tire kept going flat. He fed me dinner and breakfast, gifted me a bicycle rack, and let me use his laundry machines. One desperate night in Utica, Kentucky, I called a host with 10 minutes notice and they ended up feeding me and letting me stay in their garage. I was blown away by the acts of kindness that complete strangers consistently offered me.

I generally didn't plan sleeping arrangements more than 36 hours in advance. My mileage was highly dependent on weather, elevation change, and unforeseen delays so I had a hard time making multi-day plans.  For example, when attempting to cross the Ohio River between Illinois and Kentucky, I didn't realize that I needed to take a ferry over the water. And the ferry was conveniently closed over the weekend when I arrived at the north bank at 3pm on a Sunday.

There are loads of RV parks open for overnight bike tourists on the westside of the Rockies. They'll usually include a small campsite, access to running water, electricity, showers, and coin laundry machines. These are safe places to stay and great places to meet other traveling sightseers. They pretty much disappear once you cross over into Eastern Colorado though. There were always spots to camp along the route as I went eastward, but they were often small plots in public parks with limited access to water, showers, or bathrooms. I'd often have to call the local sheriff's office to let them know I would be spending the night at the park. In a pinch, you can always stop by the local fire department and ask them where the best campsite is. Sometimes they'll even let you sleep inside the station.

Some notable places I spent the night:  
\- a church basement in Kansas  
\- a fire station in Kentucky  
\- a greenhouse in Virginia  
\- an old pony express station in Nevada  
\- an RV park that doubled as a goat/pony farm in Colorado  
\- a bed\&breakfast for Appalachian Trail hikers in Damascus, VA  
\- a shack outside a bar in Illinois  


\[TODO: include MOV of greenhouse\]  

### On Safety

Passing through strange towns on my route, I never felt unsafe around other people. I'd always leave my bike unlocked and, assuming the forecast didn't call for rain, my supply bags outside of my tent overnight. I'd often start conversations with strangers over lunch/dinner and chat with dog walkers as I set up camp in public parks. Admittedly, I can only speak to my own experience \- a taller-than-average 25 year old white guy will have an easier time making their way through rural America than basically anyone else. With that said, I’d recommend traveling with a buddy and carrying a taser/pepper spray when possible.

The biggest precaution I took was making sure my electronics were on me at all times. I'd always put my bike computer and phone in my pocket when heading into restaurants and grocery stores. I spoke with a westbound cross-country cycling group when making my way through Nevada and one man mentioned that his phone was stolen off his bike when he left it unattended at a convenience store. 

It is worth mentioning that much of the rural American West doesn't have cell service, making **a satellite phone an absolute necessity**. Being able to quickly make SOS calls in dire circumstances and notify loved ones of my exact location, regardless of cell tower availability, was crucial. I made sure to broadcast my coordinates twice a day and keep my family/girlfriend updated as to my travel plans every morning for my own safety. I was unexpectedly delayed by a flat tire on a mountain with no bars on two separate occasions \- it was a godsend to be able to have that phone as a lifeline as I saw the sun moving closer to the horizon.

It’s important to have a general idea of the wildlife (and corresponding precautions to take) in every region on the trail. For example, passing through bear country required me to either string up all my scented supplies or put them in a bear canister. That was particularly important as I made my way through Eldorado National Forest between Folsom & South Lake Tahoe. Similarly, I didn't realize that Black Widow spiders were native to Nevada (and live in burrows right under the sand surface) until I found one crawling toward my tent. I triple-checked my cycling shoes for overnight visitors after that :)

### Joys of the Journey

Cycling across the continent is like going through a season of Planet Earth. In a single week, I went from towering redwood forests shrouded by morning fog, to crystal clear alpine lakes surrounded by pungent evergreens, to bone-dry salt flats in sweltering heat. Miles from city lights in Nevada and Colorado, the night sky presented thousands of stars and the glowing band of the Milky Way. When I made it to Kansas, the blue sky was so vast, and the horizon so uninterrupted, that I felt like I was going to fall off the face of the Earth. Cruising along the Blue Ridge parkway at sunrise, I watched the mountains turn from black to purple to blue to brown and the rising sun race across the valleys down below. I heard mooing cows, neighing horses, clucking chickens, barking dogs, chirping crickets and singing birds. Never have I felt more connected to, or grateful for, natural wonders than during this ride.

A bike touring outfit and gear collection makes a cyclist stick out like a sore thumb, inevitably attracting inquisitive strangers. People will usually have stories of their own \- either they know someone who has done something similar or are into cycling themselves. These conversations with strangers were some of the high points of my trip. I met people from all walks of life, and oftentimes they would offer to help in any way they could. Complete strangers would hand me extra food, buy me dinner, pull up beside me on the road to ask if I needed help, offer a room in their house for the night, or get their hands dirty to help me replace a flat tire. Again, this was an n=1 experience, but I was pleasantly surprised by the warmth and hospitality I encountered pretty much everywhere. What's more, I would occasionally meet crazy cyclists like me. I bumped into an Australian couple heading from Vancouver to Argentina on mountain bikes, a crew of people cycling from Boston to San Francisco with van support, and two Frenchmen heading from Montreal to San Francisco.

Another memorable aspect of riding along the TransAmerica trail was showing up to restaurants/rest stops in small towns that regularly see cyclists. In one such restaurant in Sugar City, Colorado, the owner took a quick look at me as I walked in before saying “I have something for you” and disappearing into a corner. She came back with a spiral notebook and a pen and told me to take a look. Inside were log book entries dating back years \- every cross-country cyclist who had passed through had taken time during their meal to write a personalized note. Some wrote little else but the date and the direction they were headed. Others wrote paragraphs of gratitude for the delicious meal they’d been served or diatribes on the struggles they’d endured to make it to this point. As I continued to head east from Sugar City, I found that these log books were not a rare occurrence, nearly every spot on my ACA map had something similar. These innocuous books, of all things, were what made me feel most connected to something bigger than myself during the ride. 

\[TODO: insert MOV of logbook\]

I was lucky enough to have my dad join me on the ride from the Kentucky-Virginia border to the finish line in Yorktown. Weeks of riding solo was starting to make the trip feel like a never ending journey \- seeing him and my mom in my home state was like getting an energy boost in the last mile of a marathon. Together, we pedaled through farm country, set up camp in tiny towns, and remarked at how little we’d previously seen of the state we’d both spent the majority of our lives in. It’s rare to have extended quality time with family after moving out of the house and I know we’ll both cherish this trip’s memory for the rest of our lives. I pitched my dad on doing the whole thing with me but he, understandably, wasn’t able to take two months off with such little notice \- having completed it with him I can definitely imagine wanting to take a similar journey with my own children a few years down the line.  

### Some notes for next time

\- The climb from Somerset, CA to the peak above South Lake Tahoe is sustained and there are long stretches without water.  
\- If a dog starts running at you, it probably wants to bite you more than it wants to play with you.  
\- There are basically six places to comfortably camp in Nevada so you better plan on biking some multiple of 70 miles per day or sleeping on the side of the road.  
\- The 20 mile climb (4% grade) out of Cedar City, UT is unbelievably brutal.   
\- The 10 mile climb (5% grade) to summit the Continental divide is similarly brutal.  
\- Seven of the nine states I cycled through have a city named Eureka.  
\- The 125 mile stretch between Hanksville and Blanding, Utah is nightmarish. There are NO SERVICES and only one water source (filter required).  
\- Don't believe anybody when they talk about "[prevailing winds](https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycletouring/comments/1hkblhs/how_noticable_are_headwinds_when_completing_a/#:~:text=The%20prevailing%20direction%20is%20definitely,in%20late%20spring%20and%20summer.)". Eastern Colorado and Kansas are so flat and so windy (both directions) that it will reduce most sane riders to tears.  
\- The Ozarks are hillier than expected. Several of my top 5 net elevation gain days were in Missouri.   
\- This is one of the few times in life when it makes sense to have ice cream for dinner.  
\- Appalachia is the steepest range on the route. There are several 2+ mile 7-8% grade climbs in Kentucky & Virginia.  
\- If you get three flat tires in quick succession, there’s probably something sharp embedded in your tire. Replacing your tube is necessary but not sufficient \- it might just get punctured again.

### Resources I Found Useful

My gear list and general trip prep was heavily informed by Sam Westby's How I Biked Across the U.S. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmynR8N8lNE) and corresponding [doc](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q_Oy58lwhOE_KCXRvcA8mGcItO8Vf_Ph/view). I'd highly recommend both \- you can get 90% of the way there without consuming anything else.

These videos captured the vibe of the Western Express quite well:
